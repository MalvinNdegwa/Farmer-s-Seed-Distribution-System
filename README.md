# Description
End of year 2 semester project using html, CSS and PHP that
intends to bridge the gap between farmers and seed distributor
companies. Farmers can order the seed directly to the
distribution companies hence eliminating the middle man. With
this information the companies can easily provide their products
to the farmers. Farmers have the ability to verify whether a packaged seed is from a verified distributor or counterfeit by keying in a verification code.
The system also offers agronomy tips to farmers
across the country.
